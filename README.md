Changed basic div tags to appropriate semantic tags.

  Div of class header -> header tag
  
  Div of class footer -> footer tag
  
  Divs handling side sections -> aside tag
  
  Consolidated many css rules into single rules
  
  Renamed rules to use new semantic tags
  
 Links in nav section are working properly
